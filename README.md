<b>AcitivtyRecognition</b> is google's example code from https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-location/tree/master/ActivityRecognition and will should likely be removed from this repo

<b>GoogleLoginDemo</b> is a example of how to use the new login APIs.  This example is so very basic that is doesn't do anything other then login.  As note, if you run this example of two devices with the same user and login on one device, then start the activity on the second device, it will already be logined.
